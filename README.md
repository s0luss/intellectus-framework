# INTELLECTUS FRAMEWORK
this framework is designed to help you develop hacking tools using AI as a helper.  
a lot of people who are entering the hacking and development world are falling for the vibe coding / hacking trap and that is not good.  
vibe coding / hacking is a bad way to learn. create a prompt and copy and paste code isnt going to make you a good hacker or developer.  
actually understanding the code and doing yourself is how you can learn for real.  
but does that means that AI should be prohibited?  
no.  
AI is changing the world. it is getting into our daily lives and it will not disappear.  
the world has changed. so did we.  
what if you could get the good part of vibe coding / hacking (efficiency, ideas etc) and mix it with the good part of manual coding / hacking?  
the intellectus framework should be your answer.
